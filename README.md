# YtMusicDownloader  
This is a simple python script that lets you download music from youtube using console  
It downloads mp4 audio and converts it into mp3 file  
You can download either single song or the whole playlist with it  
It pretty slow and has some issues with pytube module but it works. Definitely needs improvement though  
# Usage  
Insall necessary python modules: pytube, ffmpeg   
Change DOWNLOADS_PATH variable  
Download music from youtube :)
